# Pet Finder Mock Up - AKA Dog Seekers

## Why I built this?

I was going through a creative dry spell. I knew I wanted to build something,
but wasn't sure what to build. I figured, I like dogs and Petfinder is a pretty 
cool site, so why not build a similar site, but just for dogs? Out came Dog Seekers.
I built Dog Seekers to prove to myself that I was capable of building a large
scale project with only the help of Google. In the past, I've implemented 
features to large projects, but never built an entire large scale project; top-to-bottom.
If you're reading this, then I've accomplished exactly what I set out to do.
Granted, this site doesn't have the entire functionality of petfinder, and
there's still A LOT of work to do, but I'm happy with where it's at currently.
I've simply come to terms that I'm going to be working on this for a while. 
To me, no project is really "finished", because there's always work to be
done.

## Challenges

### Hurdle 1 - Stay Organized (even when you're mocking another site)

Normally, for apps I build from scratch, there would be at least a 1 to 2 day 
period of gathering thoughts, writing everything down and making sure to place 
these ideas into organized, structured notes and when to implement what. My 
first thoughts when doing this mockup was to simply copy the layouts from 
Petfinder.com. I learned very early on that one does not simply do that 
with a large scale web app. I learned that when building a large scale application, 
whether your mocking another web app or not, requires a lot of organization.
You have to use some sort of project management tool to organize 
your ideas, views, test specs, controllers, etc. 

### Hurdle 2 - Advanced Search Form

For the search form, I didn't use any gems. I built the search form from hours of
googling, thinking I had a solution (but really didn't), and finally arriving at
a tutorial about advanced search forms. The tutorial greatly helped me understand how search forms
actually work. After arriving at the tutorial, I learned a great deal more about
modules, models, scope, and so, so much more.

### Hurdle 3 - Action Mailer

Before this project, I never had to implement mailers. Mailers weren't
necessarily the hardest part of building this app, but simply something I've
never done. I used SendGrid to handle sending email as their free starter pack had
everything I would need for this project. Action Mailer was pretty easy to
implement and SendGrid made it a breeze to configure with Heroku. SendGrid also
has a great support team...just sayin.

### Technologies
 
  1. Rails 5
  2. RSpec
  3. Capybara
  5. JavaScript
  6. jQuery
  7. Bootstrap
  8. Bash Scripting
  9. ActionMailer
  10. SendGrid
  

### Legal Stuff
I, Kyle, the owner of this project, do not intend, and most certainly, do not
plan, to make any sort of income from the implementation of this site. The sole 
purpose of building this site was to better my skills with the aforementioned technologies
and prove to myself that I was capable.
