# Pet Finder Mock Up - AKA Dog Seeker

## Why I built this?

I built Dog Seeker to prove to myself that I was capable of building a large
scale project with only the help of Google. In the past, I've implemented
features to large projects, both small and large, but never an entire large scale 
project. If you're reading this, then I've accomplished exactly what I set out to do.
Granted, this site doesn't have the entire functionality of petfinder, but the
MVP is there. I've simply come to terms that I'm going to be working on this for
a while. To me, no project is really finished, because there's always work to be
done.

## Challenges

### Hurdle 1 - Stay Organized (even when you're mocking another site)

Normally, for apps I build from scratch, there would be at least a 1 to 2 day 
period of gathering thoughts, writing everything down and making sure to place 
these ideas into organized, structured notes and when to implement what. My 
first thoughts when doing this mockup, was to simply copy the layouts from 
Petfinder.com, but I learned very early on that one does not simply do that 
with a larger scale web app. I learned that when building a larger scale applications, 
whether your mocking another web app or not, requires a lot of organization.
You have to be able to use some sort of project management template to organize 
your ideas, pages, test specs, controllers, etc. 

### Hurdle 2 - Advanced Search Form

For the search form, I didn't use any gems. I built the search form from hours of
googling, thinking I had a solution (but really didn't), and finally arriving at
a tutorial about advanced searchs that greatly helped me understand how they
actually work. After arriving at the tutorial, I learned a great deal more about
modules, rails, scopes, and so, so much more.
